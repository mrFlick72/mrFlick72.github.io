    person to whom I owe so much and to which they are affectionate, it has been he that I gifted my first computer,
    a Sony with a built-in MSX BASIC.  The computer being used and quite old and it wasn't attractive as gaming machine
    and the only inviting job was programming. In this way I started programming in Basic since 8 years old.

    I was born in Anzio on 14th december of 1985.
    Since the age of 8 years, I have been in contact with Computers. The passion has transmitted by my uncle Cruciani
    Felice,
    person to whom I owe so much and to which they are affectionate, it has been he that I gifted my first computer,
    a Sony with a built-in MSX BASIC. The computer being used and quite old and it wasn't attractive as gaming machine
    and the only inviting job was programming. In this way I started programming in Basic since 8 years old.
    After the high school I entred in the faculty of computer engineering.
    During degree and master degree, I learned Java, C/C++, Sql, Software engineering technique,
    UML, ER, BPMN 2.0, BPEL, SOAP WS. The my Master thesis was on how build a microservice system in a cloud native
    architecture
